Hello, All!

Welcome to the repository of @Roxalthea or better known as Ronald Tang.
Here I am actively performing continuous improvment throughout multiple aspects of the IoT sector, from following latest tech news trends, to learning new programming languages.
One of which I am currently actively learning is ReactJS - As one day I would like to work in the Web Development industry.

Currently I am looking for positions in the technology industry from graduate positions to internship opportunities, as I am a 2020 graduate from RMIT University with a Bachelor of Information Technology.
Whilst at University I was able to tackle a wide variety of topics and content, from basic networking skills, Linux OS Administration, and Security.
My main focus was with developmental languages. Therefore I have learnt Java, C++, Ruby on Rails, Phython, HTML5, CSS, and PHP whilst my time there.

Thanks for reading, and enjoy your stay!
